### Fixed

- **OneDrive Folder Tree Hanging Issue**: Fixed `folder_get_tree` tool causing server hang and unresponsive behavior

  - The `childCount` includes both files AND folders, leading to API calls even for folders with only files
  - Fixed by always recursing and letting empty results naturally terminate recursion
  - Added try-catch error handling to prevent entire tree failure on single branch errors
  - Improved efficiency by only making API calls when subfolders exist
  - Server now properly handles Ctrl+C interrupts during folder tree operations
  - Location: `src/m365_mcp/tools/folder.py:185-226`

### Changed

- **Environment Variable Loading in Startup Script**: Enhanced `start_mcp_with_monitoring.sh` to automatically load environment variables from `.env` file in addition to shell environment. The `.env` file takes precedence over shell environment variables. This allows users to keep all configuration in the `.env` file without requiring shell environment variable exports.

### Changed - BREAKING

- **Project Renamed**: Renamed from `microsoft-mcp` to `m365-mcp` for cleaner branding and consistency
  - **Package name**: `microsoft-mcp` ‚Üí `m365-mcp` (pyproject.toml:2)
  - **Module name**: `microsoft_mcp` ‚Üí `m365_mcp` (src/ folder structure)
  - **CLI command**: `microsoft-mcp` ‚Üí `m365-mcp` (pyproject.toml:21)
  - **Environment variables**: All renamed with new prefix
    - `MICROSOFT_MCP_CLIENT_ID` ‚Üí `M365_MCP_CLIENT_ID`
    - `MICROSOFT_MCP_TENANT_ID` ‚Üí `M365_MCP_TENANT_ID`
  - **Migration required**: Users must update their `.env` files and CLI commands
    - Update environment variable names in `.env` configuration files
    - Update Claude Desktop config from `uvx --from git+https://github.com/robin-collins/microsoft-mcp.git microsoft-mcp` to `uvx --from git+https://github.com/robin-collins/m365-mcp.git m365-mcp`
    - Update any scripts or automation using old package/module names
  - All documentation, shell scripts, and test files updated to reflect new naming

### Added

- **Server Version Tool**: Added new `server_get_version` tool that returns the current version of the m365-mcp server. Useful for diagnostics, troubleshooting, and ensuring compatibility. Returns package name and semantic version string.
- **Version in Startup Logs**: Server startup logs now display the version number (e.g., "M365 MCP Server Starting v0.1.4"). Version is dynamically retrieved from package metadata to match pyproject.toml.

### Fixed

- **Token Cache Location**: Reverted token cache location from `.cache/token_cache.json` (project directory) back to `~/.m365_mcp_token_cache.json` (user home directory). Project directory may not always be user-writable, and user credentials should be stored in standard user-specific locations for proper permissions and security.
- **stdio Mode JSON-RPC Corruption**: Fixed critical issue where print statements writing to stdout corrupted JSON-RPC protocol communication in stdio mode
  - Removed debug print statement from `src/m365_mcp/__init__.py:2` that wrote to stdout
  - Updated all authentication print statements in `src/m365_mcp/auth.py` to write to stderr instead of stdout (lines 78-80, 114-121)
  - stdio transport requires exclusive stdout usage for JSON-RPC messages per MCP protocol specification
  - All diagnostic and authentication messages now properly use stderr to maintain protocol integrity

### Added
- Command-line argument `--env-file` to specify custom environment file path
  - Supports both `m365-mcp` server and `authenticate.py` script
  - Default: `.env` (maintains backward compatibility)

  - Facilitates testing different MCP server modes (stdio vs HTTP)
  - Tests now support custom env file via `TEST_ENV_FILE` environment variable
- Example environment files for different modes
  - `.env.stdio.example` - Pre-configured for stdio mode (default)
  - `.env.http.example` - Pre-configured for HTTP mode with bearer auth
  - Both include usage instructions and security notes
- `ENV_FILE_USAGE.md` - Comprehensive guide for using `--env-file` argument with examples and use cases

### Changed
- **Environment Loading**: Refactored environment loading to occur before module imports in `server.py` and `authenticate.py`
- **Auth Module**: Removed module-level `load_dotenv()` from `auth.py` (now loaded by caller before import)

### Added

- **Comprehensive Logging System**: Multi-tier structured logging for production debugging and monitoring
  - `src/microsoft_mcp/logging_config.py` - Centralized logging configuration with structured JSON and human-readable formats
  - Multiple log outputs: JSON structured logs (`mcp_server_all.jsonl`), error-only logs (`mcp_server_errors.jsonl`), human-readable logs (`mcp_server.log`)
  - Automatic log rotation (10 files √ó 10MB per log type)

  - Added warning logging for authentication failures with reason codes
  - Added info logging for successful authenticated requests with status and duration

### Fixed

- **HTTP Transport MCP Endpoint Routing**: Fixed critical routing issue where `/mcp` endpoint returned 307 redirect followed by 404 error. Root cause was double-path mounting - `mcp.http_app()` returns an app with routes already at `/mcp`, so mounting it again at `/mcp` created incorrect paths. Fixed by mounting the FastMCP app at root `/` instead of at the configured path. (`src/microsoft_mcp/server.py:160`)
- **Shell Script Variable Quoting**: Fixed shellcheck warnings in `start_mcp_with_monitoring.sh` by properly quoting variables in command substitutions to prevent globbing and word splitting issues (`${PID_FILE}`, `${MONITOR_PID_FILE}`)

### Added

- **Phase 3 Validation Tests**: Added targeted suites covering update dictionary guards, pagination limits, and search date windows (`tests/test_contact_validation.py`, `tests/test_email_rules_validation.py`, `tests/test_search_validation.py`, `tests/test_folder_validation.py`).
- **Phase 4 Validation Tests**: Added read-only coverage for folder choice, query bounds, and path validation (`tests/test_email_validation.py`, `tests/test_search_validation.py`, `tests/test_folder_validation.py`).

- **Parameter Validation Phase 1 Tasklist Review**: Comprehensive review and update of Phase 1 implementation plan
  - **Review Summary**: Created `reports/todo/PHASE1_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md` documenting critical findings
  - **Key Finding**: All 7 tools (5 delete + 2 send/reply) **already have** confirm validation - Phase 1 is REFACTORING task
  - **Scope Clarification**: Phase 1 refactors 7 tools (not 5) to use shared validators:
    - 5 Critical (Delete): email_delete, file_delete, contact_delete, calendar_delete_event, emailrules_delete

  (`tests/test_email_validation.py`, `tests/test_calendar_validation.py`)
  covering recipient normalization, reply body enforcement, calendar response
  enums, and datetime windows.

### Changed

- Hardened moderate operations as part of Phase 3: enforced strict whitelist validation for `email_update`, `calendar_update_event`, `contact_update`, and `emailrules_update`; applied explicit limit bounds across email, folder, contact, file, and search tools; added day-range validation to `search_events`; normalised error handling to emit `ValidationError` for rejected input.

  - Original monolithic `tools.py` backed up to `reference/tools_monolithic_original.py`

### Changed - BREAKING

- **Phase 1 Confirmation Refactor**: Replaced inline `confirm` checks in `email_send`, `email_reply`, `email_delete`, `file_delete`, `contact_delete`, `calendar_delete_event`, and `emailrules_delete` with the shared `require_confirm` validator. The tools now emit standardized `ValidationError` messages (`Invalid confirm 'False': ‚Ä¶ Expected: Explicit user confirmation`) while preserving original signatures and metadata.
- **Tool Naming Convention Migration**: All 50 MCP tools have been renamed to follow `category_verb_entity` convention for better organization and clarity:
  - **Account tools** (3): `list_accounts` ‚Üí `account_list`, `authenticate_account` ‚Üí `account_authenticate`, `complete_authentication` ‚Üí `account_complete_auth`
  - **Email tools** (10): `list_emails` ‚Üí `email_list`, `get_email` ‚Üí `email_get`, `create_email_draft` ‚Üí `email_create_draft`, `send_email` ‚Üí `email_send`, `update_email` ‚Üí `email_update`, `delete_email` ‚Üí `email_delete`, `move_email` ‚Üí `email_move`, `reply_to_email` ‚Üí `email_reply`, `reply_all_email` ‚Üí `email_reply_all`, `get_attachment` ‚Üí `email_get_attachment`

  - **Search tools** (5): `search_files`, `search_emails`, `search_events`, `search_contacts` (unchanged), `unified_search` ‚Üí `search_unified`
- **Safety Annotations**: All tools now include FastMCP `annotations` parameter with safety hints:
  - `readOnlyHint`: Indicates read-only operations (23 safe tools)
  - `destructiveHint`: Marks destructive operations like delete (5 critical tools)
  - `idempotentHint`: Indicates if repeated calls have same effect
  - `openWorldHint`: Always true for all tools
- **Meta Information**: All tools include `meta` parameter with categorization:
  - `category`: Tool category (account, email, emailfolders, emailrules, calendar, contact, file, folder, search)
  - `safety_level`: Safety classification (safe, moderate, dangerous, critical)
  - `requires_confirmation`: Flagged for dangerous/critical operations
- **Enhanced Descriptions**: All tool descriptions now include:
  - Emoji visual indicators (üìñ safe, ‚úèÔ∏è moderate, üìß dangerous, üî¥ critical, ‚ö†Ô∏è special caution)
  - Safety hints in parentheses (e.g., "read-only, safe for unsupervised use")
  - WARNING messages for dangerous/critical operations
  - Comprehensive documentation with examples for complex tools
- **Confirmation Parameters**: Added required `confirm: bool = False` parameter to all dangerous and critical operations:
  - **Dangerous (Send)**: `email_send`, `email_reply`, `email_reply_all` - must set `confirm=True` to send emails
  - **Critical (Delete)**: `email_delete`, `emailrules_delete`, `calendar_delete_event`, `contact_delete`, `file_delete` - must set `confirm=True` to delete
  - All confirmation-required tools raise `ValueError` with clear message if `confirm` is not `True`

### Added 2025-10-04

- **Streamable HTTP Transport Support** - Modern MCP Streamable HTTP protocol (spec 2025-03-26+) for web/API access with configurable host/port/path
- **Bearer Token Authentication** - Secure token-based authentication for HTTP transport with automatic validation
- **OAuth Authentication Support** - Enterprise-grade OAuth 2.0 authentication for HTTP transport (FastMCP 2.0+)
- **Security Safeguards**:
  - HTTP transport refuses to start without authentication (requires explicit `MCP_ALLOW_INSECURE=true` override)
  - Token length validation (minimum 32 characters recommended)
  - Network binding warnings for `0.0.0.0` exposure
  - Health check endpoint at `/health` (no auth required)
  - MCP endpoint at configurable path (default `/mcp`)
- Email folder navigation tools:
  - `list_mail_folders` - List root or child mail folders with metadata (childFolderCount, unreadItemCount, etc.)
  - `get_mail_folder` - Get specific mail folder details by folder ID
  - `get_mail_folder_tree` - Build recursive email folder tree with configurable max depth
- OneDrive folder navigation tools:
  - `list_folders` - List only folders (not files) in OneDrive location
  - `get_folder` - Get specific OneDrive folder metadata
  - `get_folder_tree` - Build recursive OneDrive folder tree with configurable max depth
- Message rule (email filter) management tools:
  - `list_message_rules` - List all inbox message rules
  - `get_message_rule` - Get specific rule details
  - `create_message_rule` - Create new email filtering rule with conditions and actions
  - `update_message_rule` - Update existing rule
  - `delete_message_rule` - Delete a rule
  - `move_rule_to_top` - Move rule to execute first (sequence = 1)
  - `move_rule_to_bottom` - Move rule to execute last
  - `move_rule_up` - Move rule up one position in execution order
  - `move_rule_down` - Move rule down one position in execution order
- Enhanced `list_emails` to support direct folder ID lookup via new `folder_id` parameter
- Enhanced `list_files` to support `folder_id` parameter and `type_filter` for filtering files/folders
- Internal helper functions for code reuse:
  - `_list_mail_folders_impl()` - Email folder listing implementation
  - `_list_folders_impl()` - OneDrive folder listing implementation

### Changed

- `list_emails` now accepts optional `folder_id` parameter for direct folder access (takes precedence over `folder` name)
- `list_emails` `folder` parameter is now optional (defaults to "inbox" if neither `folder` nor `folder_id` provided)
- `list_files` now accepts `folder_id` parameter for direct folder access and `type_filter` to filter by files/folders/all
- `list_files` maintains backward compatibility with existing path-based calls

### Fixed

- Fixed "'FunctionTool' object is not callable" error in `get_mail_folder_tree` by extracting shared logic into internal helper function
- Fixed `AttributeError: 'FastMCP' object has no attribute 'get_asgi_app'` by using correct `http_app()` method for Streamable HTTP transport
- Fixed auth middleware to gracefully handle browser requests (favicon.ico, robots.txt) by returning 404 instead of 401
- Fixed auth middleware 500 errors by returning JSONResponse instead of raising HTTPException (proper handling of 401 unauthorized requests)

### Documentation

- Added `QUICKSTART.md` - Quick start guide for installation, configuration, and first-time setup
- Added `.env.example` - Template file with all configuration options and detailed comments
- Added `EMAIL_OUTPUT_FORMAT.md` - Comprehensive guide to email reading output format, metadata fields, and AI interaction examples

### Dependencies

- Added `fastapi>=0.115.0` - Required for Streamable HTTP transport with bearer auth middleware
- Added `uvicorn>=0.32.0` - ASGI server for Streamable HTTP transport

### Notes

- Uses modern MCP Streamable HTTP protocol (spec 2025-03-26+) instead of deprecated SSE transport
- Streamable HTTP provides bidirectional communication over single endpoint at `/mcp`
