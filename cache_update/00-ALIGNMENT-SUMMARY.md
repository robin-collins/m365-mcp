# Cache Implementation Documents - Alignment Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the alignment updates made to ensure all cache implementation documents are cohesive and compliant with project steering documentation.

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: ✅ Aligned
**Documents Updated**: 4 (README.md, 06, 07, 08)

---

## Critical Findings & Resolutions

### 1. Encryption Missing from Earlier Documents ❌ → ✅

**Issue**: Document 09-encryption-security.md was created after documents 01-07, but encryption requirements weren't integrated into the core implementation plan.

**Impact**: HIGH - Encryption is a critical security requirement (GDPR/HIPAA compliance)

**Resolution**:
- ✅ Updated README.md to include 09-encryption-security.md
- ✅ Updated 07-implementation-plan.md to add encryption phase (Days 1-3)
- ✅ Added encryption dependencies (sqlcipher3, keyring)
- ✅ Extended timeline from 9 days to 14 days
- ✅ Added security testing and compliance validation

### 2. Cache Warming Missing from Implementation Plan ❌ → ✅

**Issue**: Document 08-cache-warming.md detailed cache warming implementation but wasn't included in the phased rollout plan.

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Performance optimization feature not scheduled

**Resolution**:
- ✅ Added cache warming to Phase 2 (Day 6)
- ✅ Included CacheWarmer module in file creation list
- ✅ Added cache warming tests and monitoring
- ✅ Updated configuration requirements

### 3. Tool Naming Convention Violations ❌ → ✅

**Issue**: Cache tools didn't follow the naming conventions specified in `.projects/steering/tool-names.md`

**Violations**:
- `task_get_status` → should be `cache_task_get_status`
- `task_list` → should be `cache_task_list`

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Inconsistent with project standards

**Resolution**:
- ✅ Updated tool names in 06-task-queue.md
- ✅ Added proper safety annotations (readOnlyHint, destructiveHint)
- ✅ Added emoji indicators (📖 for read-only, ✏️ for write)
- ✅ Added meta fields (category, safety_level)
- ✅ Updated 08-cache-warming.md tool name

### 4. Timeline Inconsistencies ❌ → ✅

**Issue**: Original plan was 9 days, but encryption (5 days) and cache warming (1 day) weren't accounted for.

**Impact**: HIGH - Unrealistic timeline expectations

**Resolution**:
- ✅ Updated timeline from 9 days to 14 days
- ✅ Restructured into 5 phases (was 4)
- ✅ Added Phase 5 for comprehensive documentation and release prep
