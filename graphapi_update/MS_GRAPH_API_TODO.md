## Notes and Considerations

### Development Tips

- Work through phases sequentially (Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8)
- Commit after each major milestone for easy rollback
- Test frequently during implementation
- Use feature flags if needed for gradual rollout
- Keep documentation updated as you implement

### Testing Strategy

- Write unit tests before implementation (TDD approach)
- Test both personal and work/school account paths
- Mock Graph API responses for consistent testing
- Use real accounts for integration testing
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Don't break existing tool signatures
- ❌ Don't forget backward compatibility
- ❌ Don't skip type annotations
- ❌ Don't log sensitive tokens
- ❌ Don't assume mail field always exists
- ❌ Don't use blocking operations in async contexts

### Performance Considerations

- Account type detection happens once per auth (cached)
- Personal account unified search is sequential (acceptable overhead)
- OData search may be faster than unified search for single entity types
- Monitor API rate limits during testing

### Security Reminders

- JWT decoding without verification is safe here (token already validated by MSAL)
- Never log full access tokens
- Validate all user inputs
- Don't expose sensitive data in error messages
- Use least privilege for all operations
