# Test Report: test_check_availability

## Test Status: FAILED

## Test Purpose
Test the `calendar_check_availability` tool functionality to check user availability for scheduling.

## Failure Analysis

### Primary Issue: Null Reference Error
**Error Message:** `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'casefold'`

**Root Cause:** The test fails due to a null reference error in the `calendar_check_availability` tool implementation. The error occurs at line 549 in `calendar.py`:
```
current_keys = {m.casefold() for m in me_info}
```

### Technical Details
- **Test Location:** `tests/test_integration.py::test_check_availability`
- **Failure Type:** AttributeError - NoneType
- **Error Location:** `src/m365_mcp/tools/calendar.py:549`
- **Impact:** The tool fails during execution due to improper null handling

### Test Parameters
The test was attempting to call the tool with:
- `account_id`: User's account identifier
- `start`: ISO timestamp for tomorrow at 10:00 AM
- `end`: ISO timestamp for tomorrow at 5:00 PM
- `attendees`: List containing the user's own email address

### Root Cause Analysis
The error suggests that `me_info` is `None` when the code attempts to access it. Looking at the stack trace:
1. The tool gets user information (`me_info`)
2. It attempts to create a set of casefolded keys from `me_info`
3. Since `me_info` is `None`, calling `.casefold()` on it fails

### Likely Causes
1. **API Response Issue:** The Microsoft Graph API call to get user information may be returning `None`
2. **Authentication Problem:** The user information retrieval may be failing due to authentication issues
3. **Data Processing Error:** The user information may not be properly processed or parsed
4. **Missing User Data:** The user account may not have the required profile information

### Code Issue
The code assumes `me_info` will always contain valid data, but doesn't handle the case where it might be `None`. This is a defensive programming issue where null checks should be implemented.

### Recommendations
1. **Add Null Checks:** Implement proper null checking before accessing `me_info` attributes
2. **Debug API Response:** Investigate why the user information API call is returning `None`
3. **Improve Error Handling:** Add better error handling and logging to identify the root cause
4. **Validate Input Data:** Ensure the user account has the required profile information
5. **Test Authentication:** Verify that the authentication is working correctly for the user account

### Additional Context
The availability checking functionality is critical for scheduling features. The test was attempting to:
1. Set up a time range for the next day
2. Check availability for the user's own email address
3. Verify that the availability check returns appropriate results

The failure prevents testing of this important calendar scheduling feature.
