# Test Report: test_delete_file

## Test Status: FAILED

## Test Purpose
Test the `file_create` tool functionality as a prerequisite to testing file deletion.

## Failure Analysis

### Primary Issue: Path Validation Error (Cascading Failure)
**Error Message:** `Invalid onedrive_path 'mcp-test-delete-20251014-064654.txt': must start with '/'. Expected: Absolute OneDrive path like '/Documents/file.txt'`

**Root Cause:** The test fails because it's attempting to create a file with an invalid OneDrive path format. The path validation requires absolute paths starting with '/', but the test is providing a relative filename.

### Technical Details
- **Test Location:** `tests/test_integration.py::test_delete_file`
- **Failure Type:** ValidationError (Cascading)
- **Error Location:** `src/m365_mcp/validators.py:571` in `validate_onedrive_path`
- **Impact:** The test cannot create a file to test the `delete_file` functionality

### Test Flow
The test was attempting to:
1. Get account information
2. Create a temporary local file with "File to be deleted"
3. Call `file_create` with the filename (FAILS HERE due to path validation)
4. Parse the result to get file data
5. Call `file_delete` to delete the OneDrive file
6. Assert that the file deletion succeeded

### Path Validation Issue
The test generates filenames like `mcp-test-delete-20251014-064654.txt` but the OneDrive path validator expects:
- Paths to start with '/'
- Format like '/Documents/file.txt'
- Absolute paths, not relative filenames

### Secondary Failure
After the `file_create` call fails, the test attempts to parse the error message as JSON, resulting in:
```
JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
```

This occurs because the error message is not valid JSON, but the test's `parse_result` function expects JSON data.

### Likely Causes
1. **Test Design Issue:** The test is not providing the correct path format expected by the validator
2. **Missing Test Helper:** No helper function exists to generate proper OneDrive paths for tests
3. **Inconsistent Path Handling:** The path format requirements may not be consistently applied across tests

### Recommendations
1. **Fix Path Format:** Update the test to use absolute OneDrive paths like `/Documents/mcp-test-delete-20251014-064654.txt`
2. **Create Test Utilities:** Add utility functions to generate proper OneDrive paths for all file-related tests
3. **Improve Error Handling:** Update the `parse_result` function to handle error messages gracefully
4. **Standardize Path Format:** Ensure all file-related tests use consistent path formats
5. **Add Path Validation Tests:** Create unit tests specifically for path validation

### Additional Context
This test demonstrates a common pattern where multiple tests depend on the `file_create` functionality working correctly. When the foundational file creation fails due to path format issues, it cascades to affect other file-related tests.

The failure prevents testing of the actual `delete_file` functionality, which is a critical feature for file management operations. The test would typically:
- Create a file for testing
- Delete the file
- Verify the deletion was successful

This is essential for testing file removal capabilities in the MCP server, which is important for cleanup operations and file management workflows.
