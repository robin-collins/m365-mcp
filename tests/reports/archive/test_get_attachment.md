# Test Report: test_get_attachment

## Test Status: FAILED

## Test Purpose
Test the `email_get_attachment` tool functionality to retrieve email attachments.

## Failure Analysis

### Primary Issue: Email ID Validation Error
**Error Message:** `Invalid email_id 'AQMkADAwATM3ZmYAZS0wOGUxLWZiNzAt…2gAAAA==': contains unsupported characters. Expected: Alphanumeric with - . _ !`

**Root Cause:** The test fails because the email ID returned by Microsoft Graph API contains characters that are not allowed by the email ID validator. The validator expects only alphanumeric characters plus '-', '.', '_', and '!', but the actual email ID contains other characters like '=', '+', etc.

### Technical Details
- **Test Location:** `tests/test_integration.py::test_get_attachment`
- **Failure Type:** ValidationError
- **Error Location:** `src/m365_mcp/validators.py:540` in `validate_microsoft_graph_id`
- **Impact:** The test cannot retrieve attachments due to overly restrictive ID validation

### Test Flow
The test was attempting to:
1. Get account information
2. Create an email with an attachment (SUCCESS)
3. Get the email to retrieve attachment details (SUCCESS)
4. Call `email_get_attachment` with the email ID (FAILS HERE due to validation)
5. Assert that the attachment retrieval succeeded

### Email ID Format Issue
The Microsoft Graph API returns email IDs in a format like:
`AQMkADAwATM3ZmYAZS0wOGUxLWZiNzAt…2gAAAA==`

But the validator expects:
- Only alphanumeric characters
- Plus: '-', '.', '_', '!'
- No other special characters

### Validation Logic
The validator uses a regex pattern that doesn't account for the actual format of Microsoft Graph email IDs, which often contain:
- Base64-encoded characters
- Equals signs ('=')
- Plus signs ('+')
- Other URL-safe characters

### Likely Causes
1. **Validator Too Restrictive:** The email ID validator is more restrictive than the actual Microsoft Graph API format
2. **Format Misunderstanding:** The validator may be designed for a different type of ID format
3. **API Change:** Microsoft Graph API may have changed the ID format without updating the validator

### Recommendations
1. **Update Validator:** Modify the email ID validator to accept the actual Microsoft Graph email ID format
2. **Research ID Format:** Document the expected Microsoft Graph email ID format
3. **Test with Real IDs:** Verify the validator works with actual email IDs from the API
4. **Add Format Examples:** Include examples of valid email IDs in the validator
5. **Review Other Validators:** Check if other Microsoft Graph ID validators have similar issues

### Additional Context
This test successfully creates an email with an attachment and retrieves the email details, but fails when trying to get the specific attachment. The attachment functionality appears to be working (the email creation and retrieval succeed), but the ID validation prevents the final step.

The failure prevents testing of the actual attachment retrieval functionality, which is a critical feature for email management operations.
