# Test Report: test_get_file

## Test Status: FAILED

## Test Purpose
Test the `file_create` tool functionality as a prerequisite to testing file retrieval.

## Failure Analysis

### Primary Issue: Path Validation Error
**Error Message:** `Invalid onedrive_path 'mcp-test-get-20251014-064624.txt': must start with '/'. Expected: Absolute OneDrive path like '/Documents/file.txt'`

**Root Cause:** The test fails because it's attempting to create a file with an invalid OneDrive path format. The path validation requires absolute paths starting with '/', but the test is providing a relative filename.

### Technical Details
- **Test Location:** `tests/test_integration.py::test_get_file`
- **Failure Type:** ValidationError
- **Error Location:** `src/m365_mcp/validators.py:571` in `validate_onedrive_path`
- **Impact:** The test cannot create a file to test the `get_file` functionality

### Test Flow
The test was attempting to:
1. Get account information
2. Create a temporary local file with test content
3. Call `file_create` with the filename (FAILS HERE due to path validation)
4. Parse the result to get file data
5. Use the file data to test the `get_file` tool
6. Assert that the file retrieval succeeded

### Path Validation Issue
The test generates filenames like `mcp-test-get-20251014-064624.txt` but the OneDrive path validator expects:
- Paths to start with '/'
- Format like '/Documents/file.txt'
- Absolute paths, not relative filenames

### Secondary Failure
After the `file_create` call fails, the test attempts to parse the error message as JSON, resulting in:
```
JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
```

This occurs because the error message is not valid JSON, but the test's `parse_result` function expects JSON data.

### Likely Causes
1. **Test Design Issue:** The test is not providing the correct path format expected by the validator
2. **Documentation Gap:** The test may not be following the documented path format requirements
3. **Validator Mismatch:** The validator may be too strict or the test may be using outdated path format

### Recommendations
1. **Fix Path Format:** Update the test to use absolute OneDrive paths like `/Documents/mcp-test-get-20251014-064624.txt`
2. **Update Test Helper:** Modify the test to generate proper OneDrive paths
3. **Improve Error Handling:** Update the `parse_result` function to handle error messages gracefully
4. **Document Path Requirements:** Ensure the path format requirements are clearly documented
5. **Add Path Validation Tests:** Create unit tests specifically for path validation

### Additional Context
This test demonstrates the importance of proper input validation and the need for tests to follow the exact API contract. The file creation functionality appears to be working (validation is occurring), but the test needs to provide input in the expected format.

The failure prevents testing of the actual `get_file` functionality, which is a critical feature for file management operations.
