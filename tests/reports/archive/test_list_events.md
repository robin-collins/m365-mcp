# Test Report: test_list_events

## Test Status: FAILED

## Test Purpose
Test the `calendar_list_events` tool functionality to retrieve calendar events.

## Failure Analysis

### Primary Issue: Unknown Tool
**Error Message:** `Unknown tool: calendar_list_events`

**Root Cause:** The test is attempting to call a tool named `calendar_list_events` that does not exist in the MCP server's tool registry. The server logs show:
```
Tool cache miss for calendar_list_events, refreshing cache
Tool 'calendar_list_events' not listed, no validation will be performed
```

### Technical Details
- **Test Location:** `tests/test_integration.py::test_list_events`
- **Failure Type:** Tool Not Found
- **Server Response:** The MCP server returns an error indicating the tool is unknown
- **Impact:** The test cannot proceed as the fundamental tool being tested is not available

### Test Parameters
The test was attempting to call the tool with:
- `account_id`: User's account identifier
- `days_ahead`: 14 (to get events for the next 14 days)
- `include_details`: True (to get detailed event information)

### Likely Causes
1. **Tool Not Implemented:** The `calendar_list_events` tool may not have been implemented in the server
2. **Tool Name Mismatch:** The tool may exist but with a different name (e.g., `list_events`, `calendar_events`)
3. **Tool Registration Issue:** The tool may be implemented but not properly registered with the MCP server
4. **Missing Tool Definition:** The tool definition may be missing from the calendar tools module

### Recommendations
1. Verify if the `calendar_list_events` tool exists in the codebase
2. Check the tool registration process in the server initialization
3. Ensure the tool name matches exactly between the test and implementation
4. If the tool doesn't exist, implement it according to the expected interface
5. Update the test to use the correct tool name if it has been renamed

### Additional Context
The test was attempting to:
1. Get account information
2. Call `calendar_list_events` to retrieve upcoming events
3. Assert that the operation succeeded and returned event data

Since the tool is not recognized by the server, the test fails immediately at the tool call stage, preventing any calendar functionality testing.
