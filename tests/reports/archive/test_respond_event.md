# Test Report: test_respond_event

## Test Status: FAILED

## Test Purpose
Test the `calendar_list_events` tool functionality to retrieve calendar events for responding to a specific event.

## Failure Analysis

### Primary Issue: Unknown Tool (Cascading Failure)
**Error Message:** `Unknown tool: calendar_list_events`

**Root Cause:** The test fails because it depends on `calendar_list_events` to first retrieve events before attempting to respond to a specific event. The server logs show:
```
Tool cache miss for calendar_list_events, refreshing cache
Tool 'calendar_list_events' not listed, no validation will be performed
```

### Technical Details
- **Test Location:** `tests/test_integration.py::test_respond_event`
- **Failure Type:** Tool Not Found (Cascading)
- **Server Response:** The MCP server returns an error indicating the tool is unknown
- **Impact:** The test fails at the first step, preventing the actual `respond_event` functionality from being tested

### Test Flow
The test was attempting to:
1. Get account information
2. Call `calendar_list_events` to retrieve events (FAILS HERE)
3. Parse the result to get event data
4. Use an event ID to test the `respond_event` tool with a response type (Accept/Decline/Tentative)
5. Assert that the event response succeeded

### Secondary Failure
After the initial `calendar_list_events` call fails, the test attempts to parse the error message as JSON, resulting in:
```
JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
```

This occurs because the error message "Unknown tool: calendar_list_events" is not valid JSON, but the test's `parse_result` function expects JSON data.

### Likely Causes
1. **Tool Not Implemented:** The `calendar_list_events` tool may not have been implemented
2. **Tool Name Mismatch:** The tool may exist but with a different name
3. **Tool Registration Issue:** The tool may not be properly registered with the MCP server
4. **Missing Tool Definition:** The tool definition may be missing from the calendar tools module

### Recommendations
1. Fix the `calendar_list_events` tool issue first (see test_list_events.md)
2. Ensure the `respond_event` tool is properly implemented and registered
3. Update the test to handle error cases gracefully instead of attempting to parse error messages as JSON
4. Consider adding proper error handling in the `parse_result` function to distinguish between JSON data and error messages
5. Verify that the event response functionality works with proper event IDs

### Additional Context
This test is part of the calendar functionality suite that depends on the foundational `calendar_list_events` tool. The test would typically:
- Find an existing event
- Send a response (Accept/Decline/Tentative) to that event
- Verify the response was processed correctly

The failure prevents testing of the actual event response functionality, which is a critical feature for calendar management.
