# Test Report: test_search_emails

## Test Status: FAILED

## Test Purpose
Test the `search_emails` tool functionality to search for emails in Outlook.

## Failure Analysis

### Primary Issue: Microsoft Graph API Error
**Error Message:** `Client error '400 Bad Request' for url 'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/search/query'`

**Root Cause:** The test fails because the Microsoft Graph API returns a 400 Bad Request error when attempting to search for emails. This indicates that the search request is malformed or the search functionality is not properly configured.

### Technical Details
- **Test Location:** `tests/test_integration.py::test_search_emails`
- **Failure Type:** HTTPStatusError - 400 Bad Request
- **API Endpoint:** `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/search/query`
- **Impact:** The email search functionality cannot be tested due to API request issues

### Test Parameters
The test was attempting to call `search_emails` with:
- `account_id`: User's account identifier
- `query`: "test" (search term)
- `limit`: 5 (maximum number of results)

### API Request Details
The error occurs in the `search_query` method in `graph.py` at line 302, where the HTTP request is made to the Microsoft Graph search endpoint.

### Likely Causes
1. **Missing Permissions:** The application may not have the required permissions for search functionality
2. **Invalid Search Parameters:** The search request parameters may be malformed or invalid
3. **API Configuration Issue:** The search endpoint may not be properly configured or enabled
4. **Query Format Issue:** The search query format may not match what the API expects
5. **Tenant Configuration:** The tenant may not have search functionality enabled

### Microsoft Graph Search Requirements
The Microsoft Graph search API typically requires:
- Proper authentication and permissions
- Valid search query parameters
- Correct entity type specifications (e.g., "message" for emails)
- Proper request formatting

### Recommendations
1. **Check Permissions:** Verify that the application has the required permissions for search functionality
2. **Review API Documentation:** Check the Microsoft Graph search API documentation for correct parameter format
3. **Debug Request:** Add logging to see the exact request being sent to the API
4. **Test with Simple Query:** Try with a simpler search query to isolate the issue
5. **Verify Tenant Settings:** Check if search functionality is enabled in the tenant
6. **Add Error Handling:** Improve error handling to provide more detailed error information

### Additional Context
The email search functionality is a critical feature for email management operations. The test was attempting to:
1. Search for emails containing the term "test"
2. Limit results to 5 items
3. Verify that the search returns appropriate results

The failure prevents testing of the search functionality, which is essential for users to find emails in their Outlook mailbox.

### Related Issues
This same 400 Bad Request error pattern appears in other search-related tests (search_files, search_events, search_unified), suggesting a systemic issue with the search API implementation or configuration. All search functionality appears to be affected by the same underlying issue.
